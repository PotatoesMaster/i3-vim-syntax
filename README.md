This is a [Vim](http://vim.org) syntax file for [i3](http://i3wm.org/) config file.

## Using it

You can install it using a Vim plugin manager ([Vundle], [Pathogen], â€¦) or just by putting [i3.vim][i3vim] in your `~/.vim/syntax` directory.

I recommend you to add `# vim:filetype=i3` at the end of your i3 config file, unless you really want to type `:set filetype=i3` every time you edit this file.
